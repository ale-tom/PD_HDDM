Model fitting is implemented on iPython using Wiecki's Hierarchical Drift-Diffusion Modelling toolbox. Each model tested in the paper is implemented on a separate Jupyter notebook. Please note that model fitting will require a long time (approx 15 hours on a Mac Pro with 4 CPUs). Estimated model parameters (including DICs) are reported in Stats_Model#.txt files.
